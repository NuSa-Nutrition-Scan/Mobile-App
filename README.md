# Mobile-App
## Introduction
The mobile app serves as the primary interface for the NuSa Mobile application. It acts as the user's initial point of interaction, allowing them to directly engage with the app. Once the user inputs data, it is then transmitted to the API. Subsequently, the app presents the information retrieved from the API to the user.
